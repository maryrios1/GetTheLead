0	worst...episode......ever. #coachella #Coachella2015
0	The #Coachella2015 lineup is definitely lacking.
0	Me at #Coachella2015 when drake fans walk by. http://t.co/3vHUbhNfbn
0	Not even when The cure or Suede played, did I want to go. #Coachella2015 I went to the very first one &amp; that was enough. Over it. 😣
0	I wish #incubus or #sonsofthesea would have been on the #Coachella2015 lineup
0	Who designs the #Coachella2015 posters? Get a head ache as soon as I look at it.
0	Not excited that mainstream hip hop/R&amp
0	Looking at the #Coachella2015 line up like... "who are these people!?"

0	@MarinasDiamonds skip #Coachella2015 and visit Australia again 😔
0	Not highly impressed w/ the lineup. Friday looks like the best day. It just seems lacking and not terribly worth the paper.
0	You know, just another year of probably not going to #Coachella2015 😭😭😭
0	Oh #Coachella2015 why are you so expensive? Wish I could go. @hozier @alt_J @badreligion @davidguetta and many more 😩

0	@lisa_TTRO @coachella not as excited with the lineup this year. It's still good though #Coachella2015
0	ACDC, bad religion, and jack white at #Coachella2015 ... Is this KROQ's weenie roast circa 2000? No thank you.
0	The people that spend $5k on a weekend festival are nuuuts. And loaded. #Coachella2015
0	Coachella line up this year is so weak . #Coachella2015
0	That sad moment when #Coachella2015 and #BottleRockNapa release their lineups on the same day and I can't afford tickets to either 😭 😭
0	Saw #Coachella2015 line up and honestly... this is the first year that I'm not pressed to go.
0	If I wanted to hear AC DC and a whole lot of metallic noise I'd go to Jiffy Lube and save a few thousand dollars
0	#Coachella2015 lineup is trash to be honest... I would only want to see the weeknd but other than that not spending my money on it

0	Me at #Coachella2015 when drake fans walk by. http://t.co/3vHUbhNfbn
0	Not even when The cure or Suede played, did I want to go. #Coachella2015 I went to the very first one &amp; that was enough. Over it. 😣
0	I wish #incubus or #sonsofthesea would have been on the #Coachella2015 lineup
0	Who designs the #Coachella2015 posters? Get a head ache as soon as I look at it.

0	@lisa_TTRO @coachella not as excited with the lineup this year. It's still good though #Coachella2015
0	ACDC, bad religion, and jack white at #Coachella2015 ... Is this KROQ's weenie roast circa 2000? No thank you.
0	The people that spend $5k on a weekend festival are nuuuts. And loaded. #Coachella2015
0	Coachella line up this year is so weak . #Coachella2015
0	That sad moment when #Coachella2015 and #BottleRockNapa release their lineups on the same day and I can't afford tickets to either 😭 😭
0	Saw #Coachella2015 line up and honestly... this is the first year that I'm not pressed to go.
0	If I wanted to hear AC DC and a whole lot of metallic noise I'd go to Jiffy Lube and save a few thousand dollars
